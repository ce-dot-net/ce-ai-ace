# Changelog

All notable changes to the ACE (Agentic Context Engineering) plugin will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.3.5] - 2025-10-16

### Fixed
- **Database Table Initialization** - Fixed offline training to initialize all database tables before use
  - Error: `sqlite3.OperationalError: no such table: patterns` when running `/ace-train-offline`
  - Root cause: `offline-training.py` created epochs tables via `epoch-manager.py` but didn't initialize main `patterns` table
  - Solution: Call `init_database()` from `ace-cycle.py` at start of offline training to create all required tables
  - Offline training now properly initializes complete database schema (patterns, insights, observations, epochs)

## [2.3.4] - 2025-10-16

### Fixed
- **Database Directory Creation** - Fixed offline training to create `.ace-memory/` directory before database initialization
  - Error: `sqlite3.OperationalError: unable to open database file` when running `/ace-train-offline` on fresh projects
  - Root cause: `epoch-manager.py` tried to create database without ensuring parent directory exists
  - Solution: Added `DB_PATH.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)` in `init_epochs_table()`
  - Offline training now works correctly on projects without existing `.ace-memory/` directory

## [2.3.3] - 2025-10-16

### Fixed
- **Command Bash Execution** - Consolidated multi-block bash scripts into single blocks
  - Fixed ace-train-offline.md: Combined plugin path detection and script execution into one bash block
  - Fixed ace-force-reflect.md: Combined file detection, validation, and ACE cycle trigger into one bash block
  - Root cause: Claude Code executes each markdown bash block independently; variables don't persist across blocks
  - Commands now execute properly with persistent variable scope throughout the entire script

### Technical Details
- Issue: Separate bash code blocks in command markdown files don't share variable scope
- Variables like `$PLUGIN_PATH` defined in one block weren't available in subsequent blocks
- Error: "parse error near `fi'" when trying to reference undefined variables
- Solution: Consolidate all bash logic into single code blocks per command

## [2.3.2] - 2025-10-16

### Fixed
- **Command Registration** - Added missing `"commands": "./commands"` field to plugin.json
  - All 8 slash commands now properly registered and discoverable in Claude Code CLI
  - Commands: /ace-status, /ace-patterns, /ace-force-reflect, /ace-clear, /ace-train-offline, /ace-export-patterns, /ace-import-patterns, /ace-export-speckit
- **Script Path Resolution** - Fixed all command files to use robust path detection
  - Prefer `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` environment variable when available (hooks context)
  - Fallback to dynamic `find` command for marketplace installations (slash command context)
  - Updated: ace-train-offline.md, ace-force-reflect.md, ace-export-patterns.md, ace-import-patterns.md
- **Script Naming** - Corrected ace-train-offline.md to reference correct script name (offline-training.py)
- **File Permissions** - Made missing scripts executable: offline-training.py, pattern-portability.py, convergence-checker.py
- **Command Metadata** - Added `allowed-tools: Bash` frontmatter to command files for proper tool access

### Changed
- All command files now use defensive dual-mode path resolution for marketplace compatibility
- Improved error messages when ACE plugin installation cannot be located

## [2.3.1] - 2025-10-16

  - Marketplace now supports multiple plugins (scalable architecture)
  - Follows community best practices (Anthropic, wshobson, AgiFlow patterns)
  - Eliminates version confusion between marketplace and plugin
  - **Users must uninstall old version and reinstall**: `/plugin uninstall ace-orchestration` then `/plugin install` or `/plugin marketplace update ace-plugin-marketplace`
- Updated marketplace.json source path from `"./"` to `"./plugins/ace-orchestration"`
- Repository structure now clearly separates marketplace from plugin implementation

### Migration Guide
For existing users:
1. Uninstall current version: `/plugin uninstall ace-orchestration`

3. Reinstall plugin: Enable it from plugin list
4. All patterns and settings preserved in `.ace-memory/`

## [2.1.3] - 2025-10-15

### Fixed
- **marketplace.json version sync** - Updated marketplace.json to reflect correct plugin version
  - marketplace.json was not updated in v2.1.2 release, causing version mismatch
