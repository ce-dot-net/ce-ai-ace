## Purpose

This constitution documents the coding principles learned by ACE from analyzing your codebase. These patterns have achieved ≥70% confidence through repeated observation and validation.

## Core Principles

### Python Error Handling

#### ❌ Avoid bare except

**Confidence**: 81.8% (22 observations)
**Language**: python

Bare except catches all exceptions including KeyboardInterrupt

**Playbook**: [`py-003`](../playbooks/003-avoid-bare-except/spec.md)

## How to Use This Constitution

1. **Review Regularly**: Check this file to understand learned principles
2. **Apply in Code**: Use these patterns when writing new code
3. **Challenge When Needed**: If a principle doesn't fit, ACE will learn and adapt
4. **Share with Team**: This constitution represents your codebase's wisdom

## Evolution

This constitution evolves as ACE learns. Patterns are:
- **Added** when they reach 70% confidence
- **Updated** as confidence changes
- **Removed** if confidence drops below 30% (lazy pruning)
